# Portfolio Svelte Flowbite

This is the code for my portfolio website. The initial setup is based on flowbite template for a [Svelte-TS-Starter](https://github.com/shinokada/flowbite-svelte-starter).

## Stack

- Vite
- Svelte
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- Flowbite-Svelte

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anclagen/anclagen.github.io.git
npm i
```

Start a local server with

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or build and open the project with

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Currently configured with github pages. To publish you need to build the project and then deploy using.

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

This will deploy your GitHub page to `https://<username>.github.io/<repository name>` URL. Donâ€™t forget to change the username and repository name to your personal Github username and repository, as well as update the base in the `vite.config.js` file.
